## Contact us page: This page provides users with contact information for customer support and allows them to submit inquiries or feedback.
## The website will also save user data, such as login credentials and order history, in a database using MongoDB. This will allow for faster and more efficient access to user data, as well as the ability to analyze user behavior to improve the website's functionality and user experience.
